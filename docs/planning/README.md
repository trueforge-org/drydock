| #794 Per-image config presets (imgset) | Feature complete — added `watchDigest` and `inspectTagPath` imgset properties |

| #777 Real-time Docker pull progress logging | Rate-limited pull progress logging added (`828bc86`) |
| #896 OIDC `checks.state` intermittent errors | Session race hardening (`e365a3e`) |
