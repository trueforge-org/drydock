rotate|Update Safety Controls|Automatic rollback on health check failure, maintenance windows, lifecycle hooks, and dry-run preview. Portainer can update containers but has none of these safety primitives.
shield|Free Security Scanning|Trivy vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation, and cosign verification — all free and open source. Portainer's security features require the paid Business Edition.
lock|No Paywall|Every Drydock feature is free and open source. Portainer gates security scanning, audit logs, RBAC, and most notification integrations behind the paid Business Edition.
bell|20 Notification Services|Slack, Discord, Telegram, Teams, Matrix, SMTP, MQTT, Kafka, Gotify, NTFY, and more — all free. Portainer CE has very limited notification options.
radio|23 Registry Integrations|Dedicated integrations for Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, GCR, GAR, GitLab, Quay, Harbor, Artifactory, Nexus, and more with per-registry configuration.
eye|Lightweight & Focused|Drydock uses ~80MB RAM and focuses on doing update monitoring well. Portainer is a full management platform that uses significantly more resources.
