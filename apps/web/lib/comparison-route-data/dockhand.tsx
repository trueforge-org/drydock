rotate|Update Safety Controls|Automatic rollback on health check failure, maintenance windows, lifecycle hooks, and dry-run preview. Dockhand can scan and update but lacks these safety primitives for production deployments.
radio|23 Registry Providers|Dedicated integrations for Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, GCR, GAR, GitLab, Quay, Harbor, Artifactory, Nexus, and more — broader registry support than Dockhand.
bell|20 Notification Services|Slack, Discord, Telegram, Teams, Matrix, SMTP, MQTT, Kafka, Gotify, NTFY, and more. Dockhand's notification options are more limited out of the box.
history|Free Audit Log|Full audit trail with REST API and Prometheus counter — included free. Dockhand's audit logging is gated behind the Enterprise edition.
network|SSE-Based Agents|Both tools support distributed monitoring. Drydock uses SSE-based agents for real-time communication with a centralized dashboard.
lock|Fully Open Source|Every Drydock feature is free and open source. Dockhand gates audit logs, secret management, and some features behind an Enterprise tier.
