# Test Assets

## Load Testing (Artillery)

Load-test scenarios live in `test/test.yml` and `test/test-behavior.yml` and run against the stack in `test/ci-compose.yml`.

### Profiles

- `ci`: default CI profile for regression and correctness gates (arrivalRate 2-6 req/s, 40s duration)
- `behavior`: feature-behavior profile for SSE reconnect, log routes, and write-path checks
- `stress`: higher traffic profile for manual pressure testing

### Local commands

From repo root:

```bash
./scripts/run-load-test.sh
ARTILLERY_ENV=ci ./scripts/run-load-test.sh
ARTILLERY_FILE=./test/test-behavior.yml ARTILLERY_ENV=behavior ./scripts/run-load-test.sh
ARTILLERY_ENV=stress ./scripts/run-load-test.sh
DD_LOAD_TEST_PORT=3333 ./scripts/run-load-test.sh
```

Write a JSON report file:

```bash
DD_LOAD_TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/load-test/local ./scripts/run-load-test.sh
```

Summarize a saved JSON report (including status mix + slow endpoints):

```bash
./scripts/summarize-load-test-report.sh artifacts/load-test/local/<report>.json "Load Test (Local)"
```

From `e2e/`:

```bash
npm run load:ci
npm run load:behavior
npm run load:stress
```

### Notes

- The runner prefers the pinned `e2e` Artillery install.
- If not available, it falls back to an explicit pinned `npx` version.
- The load-test stack is isolated via a dedicated Compose project name to avoid collisions with other local test stacks.
- The runner auto-selects a free random host port when `DD_LOAD_TEST_PORT` is not set.
- In CI, the workflow enables Buildx + GHA cache to speed repeated image builds.
- CI uploads Artillery JSON reports as workflow artifacts and posts a short p95/p99/request-rate summary in the job summary.
- The push CI load-test job performs a regression check against the committed baseline at `test/load-test-baselines/ci.json`.
- Regression gate is enforced with both drift and absolute thresholds: `p95 <= +20%` and `<= 1200ms`, `p99 <= +25%` and `<= 2500ms`, `request_rate >= -15%` and `>= 10 req/s`.
- You can run the same check locally with `./scripts/check-load-test-regression.sh <current.json> <baseline.json>`.
- Correctness checks (5xx, failed VUs, and optional 429 bounds) are handled by `./scripts/check-load-test-correctness.sh <report.json> "<title>"`.
- Load-test correctness gates are enforced for the CI profile.
