# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Fork point:** upstream post-8.1.1 (2025-11-27)
> **Upstream baseline:** WUD 8.1.1 + 65 merged PRs on `main` (Vue 3 migration, Alpine base image, Rocket.Chat trigger, threshold system, semver improvements, request→axios migration, and more)

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **False downgrade suggestion for multi-segment tags** — Fixed semver parsing/comparison for numeric tags like `25.04.2.1.1` so newer major tags are no longer suggested as downgrades. ([#47](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/47))
- **Configured path hardening for filesystem reads** — Added validated path resolution helpers and applied them to store paths, watcher TLS files, and MQTT TLS files before filesystem access.

### Documentation

- **Popular imgset presets** — Added a curated preset guide at `docs/configuration/watchers/popular-imgsets.md` and linked it from watcher docs.

## 1.1.3

### Bug Fixes

- **ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY on startup** — Express `trust proxy` was hard-coded to `true`, which triggers a validation error in `express-rate-limit` v8+ when the default key generator infers client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`. Replaced with a configurable `DD_SERVER_TRUSTPROXY` env var (default: `false`). Set to `1` (hop count) when behind a single reverse proxy, or a specific IP/CIDR for tighter control. ([#43](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/43))

---

## 1.1.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Misleading docker-compose file error messages** — When a compose file had a permission error (EACCES), the log incorrectly reported "does not exist" instead of "permission denied". Now distinguishes between missing files and permission issues with actionable guidance. ([#42](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/42))
- **Agent watcher registration fails on startup** — Agent component path resolved outside the runtime root (`../agent/components` instead of `agent/components`), causing "Unknown watcher provider: 'docker'" errors and preventing agent watchers/triggers from registering. ([#42](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/42))

### Improvements

- **Debug logging for component registration** — Added debug-level logging showing resolved module paths during component registration and agent component registration attempts, making path resolution issues easier to diagnose.

---

## 1.2.0

### Added

- **Grafana dashboard template** — Importable Grafana JSON dashboard with panels for overview stats, watcher activity, trigger execution, registry response times, and audit entries. Uses datasource templating for portable Prometheus configuration.
- **Audit log backend** — `AuditEntry` model, LokiJS-backed store with pagination and pruning, `GET /api/audit` endpoint with filtering, `dd_audit_entries_total` Prometheus counter, and automatic logging of container lifecycle events (update-available, update-applied, update-failed, rollback, preview, container-added, container-removed).
- **Font Awesome 6 migration** — Replaced all Material Design Icons (`mdi-*`) with Font Awesome 6 equivalents. Configured Vuetify FA icon set, updated all service icon getters, component templates, and 54 test files.
- **Dry-run preview API** — `POST /api/containers/:id/preview` returns what an update would do (current/new image, update kind, running state, networks) without performing it.
- **Pre-update image backup and rollback** — LokiJS-backed backup store records container image state before each Docker trigger update. `GET /api/backups`, `GET /api/:id/backups`, and `POST /api/:id/rollback` endpoints. Configurable retention via `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKER_{name}_BACKUP_COUNT` (default 3).
- **Frontend wiring** — Preview dialog with loading/error/success states wired to dry-run API. Full audit log table with filtering, pagination, and responsive column hiding replacing the MonitoringHistory placeholder. Recent Activity dashboard card showing latest 5 audit entries.
- **Container action bar refactor** — Replaced 3-column text button layout with compact icon-button toolbar and tooltips (desktop) or overflow menu (mobile).
- **Dashboard second row** — Added Recent Activity and stats cards as a second row on the dashboard.
- **UI modernization** — Consistent `pa-4` padding, outlined/rounded cards, tonal chips, styled empty states, and Font Awesome icons across all views and components.
- **Container actions (start/stop/restart)** — New API endpoints and UI buttons to start, stop, and restart Docker containers directly from the dashboard. Gated by `DD_SERVER_FEATURE_CONTAINERACTIONS` (default: enabled). Includes audit logging, Prometheus counter (`dd_container_actions_total`), desktop toolbar buttons with disabled-state awareness, and mobile overflow menu integration.
- **Webhook API for on-demand triggers** — Token-authenticated HTTP endpoints (`POST /api/webhook/watch`, `/watch/:name`, `/update/:name`) for CI/CD integration. Gated by `DD_SERVER_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` and `DD_SERVER_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`. Includes rate limiting (30 req/15min), audit logging, Prometheus counter (`dd_webhook_total`), and a configuration info panel on the Server settings page.
- **Container grouping / stack views** — New `GET /api/containers/groups` endpoint returns containers grouped by stack. Supports explicit group assignment via `dd.group` / `wud.group` labels with automatic fallback to `com.docker.compose.project`. Collapsible `ContainerGroup` component with group header showing name, container count, and update badges. "Smart group" filter option for automatic stack detection (`dd.group` > `wud.group` > compose project). "Update all in group" action to batch-update all containers in a group.
- **Graceful self-update UI** — Self-update detection when drydock updates its own container. Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint at `/api/events/ui` for real-time browser push. Full-screen DVD-style bouncing whale logo overlay during self-updates with smooth phase transitions (updating, restarting, reconnecting, ready). Automatic health polling and page reload after restart.
- **Lifecycle hooks (pre/post-update commands)** — Execute shell commands before and after container updates via `dd.hook.pre` and `dd.hook.post` labels. Pre-hook failures abort the update by default (`dd.hook.pre.abort=true`). Configurable timeout via `dd.hook.timeout` (default 60s). Environment variables exposed: `DD_CONTAINER_NAME`, `DD_IMAGE_NAME`, `DD_TAG_OLD`, `DD_TAG_NEW`, etc. Includes audit logging for hook success/failure and UI display in ContainerDetail panel.
- **Automatic rollback on health check failure** — Monitors container health after updates and automatically rolls back to the previous image if the container becomes unhealthy. Configured via `dd.rollback.auto=true`, `dd.rollback.window` (default 300s), and `dd.rollback.interval` (default 10s). Requires Docker HEALTHCHECK on the container. Uses existing backup store for rollback images. Includes audit logging and UI display in ContainerDetail panel.

### Fixed

- **Navigation drawer not visible** — Used computed model for permanent/temporary modes; passing `model-value=undefined` caused Vuetify to treat the drawer as closed.
- **Dark theme missing colors** — Added `info`, `success`, and `warning` color definitions to the dark theme.
- **ContainerPreview updateKind display** — Fixed structured `updateKind` object rendering with semver-diff color coding.
- **Invalid `text-body-3` CSS class** — Replaced with valid `text-body-2` in ConfigurationItem and TriggerDetail.
- **404 catch-all route** — Added catch-all redirect to home for unknown routes.

### Changed

- **Audit event wiring** — Wired audit log entries and Prometheus counter increments for rollback, preview, container-added, container-removed, update-applied, and update-failed events. Registered `ContainerUpdateFailed` event with try/catch in Docker trigger.
- **Test updates** — 20+ test files updated for v1.2.0 icon changes, CSS selectors, HomeView data model, theme toggle relocation, and audit module wiring. Removed obsolete specs.
- **Updated doc icon examples** — Switched icon examples to prefer `hl:` and `si:` prefixes over deprecated `mdi:`.
- **ConfigurationItem redesign** — Icon moved to the left with name as prominent text and type as subtitle, replacing the old badge/chip pattern across all configuration pages.
- **TriggerDetail redesign** — Same modern layout treatment as ConfigurationItem (icon left, name prominent, type subtitle).
- **Registry page brand colors** — Added brand-colored icon backgrounds for each registry provider (Docker blue, GitHub purple, AWS orange, Google blue, etc.) via `getRegistryProviderColor()` helper and new `iconColor` prop on ConfigurationItem.
- **Consistent card styling** — Unified `variant="outlined" rounded="lg"` across ContainerItem, ContainerGroup, ContainerTrigger, and WebhookInfo cards for a cohesive look.
- **Home page severity badges removed** — Removed redundant MAJOR/MINOR severity badges from the container updates list; version chip color already indicates severity.
- **History page filter bar** — Removed redundant "Update History" heading (already in app bar) and added a collapsible filter bar with active filter chips.
- **Logs page spacing** — Fixed spacing between the config item and logs card.
- **Self-update overlay responsive** — Mobile-responsive self-update overlay uses static top-center positioning with fade-in animation on small screens instead of DVD bounce.
- **QA compose enhancements** — Added HTTP trigger, basic auth, and webhook configuration to `test/qa-compose.yml` for integration testing.

### Removed

- **Dead code removal** — Deleted unused `AppFooter` and `ConfigurationStateView` components, dead computed props (`filteredUpdates`, `upToDateCount`), duplicate `isTriggering` reset, dead `mdi:` prefix replacement in IconRenderer, dead `container-deleted` listener, and Maintenance Windows placeholder.
- **Removed `@mdi/font` dependency** — Dropped unused Material Design Icons package.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Read-only Docker socket support** — Drydock's privilege drop prevented non-root users from connecting to `:ro` socket mounts. Added `DD_RUN_AS_ROOT=true` env var to skip the drop, improved EACCES error messages with actionable guidance, and documented socket proxy as the recommended secure alternative. ([#38](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/38))
- **Prometheus container gauge crash with agent containers** — The container gauge used a blacklist filter that let unknown properties (like `agent`) slip through and crash prom-client. Switched to a whitelist of known label names so unknown properties are silently ignored. ([#39](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/39))
- **Snackbar toast transparency** — Used `flat` variant for solid background on toast notifications.
- **Container filter layout broken on narrow viewports** — Filter columns rendered text vertically when the nav drawer was open because all 8 `v-col` elements had no width constraints. Added responsive breakpoints (`cols`/`sm`/`md`) so filters wrap properly across screen sizes. ([#40](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/issues/40))

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Application log viewer** — New Configuration > Logs page with a terminal-style viewer for drydock's own runtime logs (startup, polling, registry checks, trigger events, errors). Backed by an in-memory ring buffer (last 1,000 entries) exposed via `GET /api/log/entries`. Supports level filtering (debug/info/warn/error), configurable tail count (50/100/500/1,000), color-coded output, and auto-scroll to newest entries. An info tooltip shows the configured server log level.
- **Agent log source selector** — When agents are configured, a "Source" dropdown appears in the log viewer to switch between the controller's own logs and any connected agent's logs. Disconnected agents are shown but disabled. Agent logs are proxied via `GET /api/agents/:name/log/entries`.
- **Container log viewer** — New "Logs" tab in the container detail expansion panel to view container stdout/stderr output directly in the UI with tail control and refresh.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Registry and trigger crashes in agent mode** — `getSummaryTags()` and `getTriggerCounter()` also return `undefined` in agent mode. Added optional chaining to all remaining Prometheus call sites so agent mode doesn't crash when processing containers or firing triggers. (Fixes #33)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Prometheus gauge crash in agent mode** — `getWatchContainerGauge()` returns `undefined` in agent mode since Prometheus is not initialized. Added optional chaining so the `.set()` call is safely skipped. This was the root cause of containers not being discovered in agent mode. (Fixes #23, #31)

### Changed

- **su-exec privilege dropping** — Entrypoint detects the docker socket GID and drops from root to the `node` user via `su-exec` when possible. Stays root only for GID 0 sockets (Docker Desktop / OrbStack). (Refs #25)
- **tini init system** — Added `tini` as PID 1 for proper signal forwarding to the Node process.
- **Graceful shutdown** — `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers now call `process.exit()` after cleanup so the container actually stops.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-10

First semver release. Drydock adopts semantic versioning starting with this release, replacing the previous CalVer (YYYY.MM.PATCH) scheme.

### Security

- **ReDoS prevention** — Replaced vulnerable regexes in trigger template evaluation (`Trigger.ts`) with linear-time string parsing (`parseMethodCall`, `isValidPropertyPath`). Added `MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH` guards in tag transform (`tag/index.ts`) and Docker watcher (`Docker.ts`) to reject oversized user-supplied regex patterns.
- **XSS prevention** — Added `escapeHtml()` sanitizer to Telegram trigger `bold()` method, preventing HTML injection via container names or tag values.
- **Workflow hardening** — Set top-level `permissions: read-all` in `release.yml` and `codeql.yml`. Pinned all CodeQL action refs to commit hashes. Added CodeQL config to exclude `js/clear-text-logging` false positives.
- **CVE-2026-24001** — Updated `diff` dependency in e2e tests (4.0.2 → 4.0.4).

### Changed

- **+285 UI tests** — 15 new spec files and 7 expanded existing specs covering configuration views, container components, trigger detail, services, router, and app shell. UI test count: 163 → 285.
- **+59 app tests** — New edge-case tests for ReDoS guard branches, `parseMethodCall` parsing, and Docker watcher label resolution. App test count: 1,254 → 1,313.
- **Complexity refactors** — Extracted helpers from high-complexity functions: `parseTriggerList`/`applyPolicyAction` (`container.ts`), `resolveLabelsFromContainer`/`mergeConfigWithImgset` (`Docker.ts`).
- **Biome lint fixes** — `import type` corrections and unused variable cleanup across 17 files.
- **Fixed doc links** — Corrected broken fragment links in `docs/_coverpage.md`.

### Removed

- **Removed legacy `vue.config.js`** — Dead Vue CLI config file; project uses Vite.

## [2026.2.3] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **NTFY trigger auth 401** — Bearer token auth used unsupported `axios.auth.bearer` property; now sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Basic auth property names corrected to `username`/`password`. (#27)
- **Agent mode missing /health** — Added unauthenticated `/health` endpoint to the agent server, mounted before the auth middleware so Docker healthchecks work without the agent secret. (#27)

### Changed

- **Lefthook pre-push hooks** — Added `lefthook.yml` with pre-push checks (lint + build + test).
- **Removed startup warning** — Removed "Known Issue" notice from README now that container startup issues are resolved.

## [2026.2.2] - 2026-02-10

### Security

- **Cosign keyless signing** — Container image releases are now signed with Sigstore cosign keyless signing for supply chain integrity.
- **Least-privilege workflow permissions** — Replaced overly broad `read-all` with minimum specific permissions across all CI/CD workflows.
- **CodeQL and Scorecard fixes** — Resolved all high-severity CodeQL and OpenSSF Scorecard security alerts.
- **Pinned CI actions** — All CI action references pinned to commit hashes with Dockerfile base image digest.

### Added

- **Auto-dismiss notifications after container update** — New `resolvenotifications` option for triggers (default: `false`). When enabled, notification triggers automatically delete the sent message after the Docker trigger successfully updates the container. Implemented for Gotify via its `deleteMessage` API. Other providers (Slack, Discord, ntfy) can add support by overriding the new `dismiss()` method on the base Trigger class. New `containerUpdateApplied` event emitted by the Docker trigger on successful update.

### Fixed

- **Agent mode Prometheus crash** — Guard `getWatchContainerGauge().set()` against undefined in Agent mode where Prometheus is not initialized, fixing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')" crash (#23)
- **Sanitize version logging** — Sanitize version strings from env vars before logging to resolve CodeQL clear-text-logging alerts in `index.ts` and `store/migrate.ts`
- **Broken event test assertion** — Fix `expect()` without matcher in event test

### Changed

- **97% test coverage** — Boosted from 76% to 97% with 449 new tests (1,254 total across 95 test files).
- **Fuzz testing** — Added property-based fuzz tests with fast-check for Docker image name parsing.
- **Static analysis fixes** — Optional chaining, `String#replaceAll()`, `readonly` modifiers, `Number.NaN`, concise regex syntax, removed unused imports, moved functions to outer scope.
- **Reduced code duplication** — Refactored duplicated code in registries, triggers, and store test files flagged by SonarCloud.
- **Pino logging** — Replaced bunyan with pino to eliminate vulnerable transitive dependencies. Added pino-pretty for human-readable log output.
- **Renamed wud to drydock** — Project references updated from upstream naming across Dockerfile, entrypoint, package files, scripts, and test fixtures.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Added contributor guidelines.
- **OpenSSF Best Practices badge** — Added to README.
- **SonarCloud integration** — Added project configuration.
- **Multi-arch container images** — Docker images now built for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` architectures, published to GHCR.
- **Lefthook pre-push hooks** — Added lefthook config with pre-push checks (lint + build + test) and `npm run check` convenience script.
- **CodeQL query exclusion** — Exclude `js/clear-text-logging` query (false positives on DD_VERSION env var).

## [2026.1.0]

### Added

- **Agent mode** — Distributed monitoring with remote agent architecture. Agent components, SSE-based communication, dedicated API routes.
- **OIDC token lifecycle** — Remote watcher HTTPS auth with `Basic` + `Bearer` token support. TLS/mTLS compatibility for `DD_WATCHER_{name}_HOST`.
- **OIDC device-flow (Phase 2)** — RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant for headless remote watcher auth. Auto-detection, polling with backoff, and refresh token rotation.
- **Per-image config presets** — `imgset` defaults for per-image configuration. Added `watchDigest` and `inspectTagPath` imgset properties.
- **Hybrid triggers** — Trigger group defaults (`DD_TRIGGER_{name}_THRESHOLD`) shared across providers. Name-only include/exclude for multi-provider trigger management.
- **Container update policy** — Skip/snooze specific update versions. Per-container policy stored in DB, exposed via API and UI.
- **Metrics auth toggle** — `DD_SERVER_METRICS_AUTH` env var to disable auth on `/metrics` endpoint.
- **Trigger thresholds** — Digest and no-digest thresholds for triggers.
- **NTFY provider-level threshold** — Provider-level threshold support for ntfy trigger.
- **Docker pull progress logging** — Rate-limited pull progress output during docker-compose updates.
- **Registry lookup image override** — `lookupImage` field on registry config to override the image used for tag lookups.
- **Docker inspect tag path** — Support custom tag path in Docker inspect output.
- **Anonymous LSCR and TrueForge registries** — Allow anonymous access to LSCR (LinuxServer) and Quay-backed TrueForge.
- **DHI registry** — New `dhi.io` registry provider with matcher, auth flow, and docs.
- **Custom URL icons** — Support URL-based icons via `dd.display.icon` label.
- **Version skip** — Skip specific versions in the UI.
- **Log viewer** — In-app container log viewer. View Docker container stdout/stderr output directly in the UI via a new "Logs" tab on each container. Supports configurable tail line count (50/100/500), manual refresh, and Docker stream demultiplexing. Works for both local and remote agent containers.
- **Semver tag recovery** — Recover include-filter mismatched semver tags from watchers. Extended to advise best semver tag when current tag is non-semver (e.g., `latest`).
- **Dashboard update chips** — Replaced verbose update status text with compact colored chips: green "up to date" or warning "N update(s)" (clickable).

### Fixed

- **eval() code injection** — Replaced `eval()` in trigger template rendering with safe expression evaluator supporting property paths, method allowlist, ternaries, and string concatenation.
- **Digest-only update prune crash** — Docker trigger prune logic now correctly excludes current image during digest-only updates and handles post-prune errors gracefully.
- **Swarm deploy-label debug logging** — Added warn-level logging when Swarm service inspect fails, and debug logging showing which label sources contain `dd.*` labels.
- **OIDC session state races** — Serialized redirect session checks, multiple pending callback states per session.
- **semverDiff undefined** — Normalized `semverDiff` for non-tag (digest-only/created-date-only) updates.
- **Docker event stream crash** — Buffered and parsed split Docker event stream payloads.
- **Multi-network container recreate** — Reconnects additional networks after container recreation.
- **Remote watcher delayed first scan** — `watchatstart` now checks watcher-local store for new remote watchers.
- **docker-compose post_start hooks** — Hooks now execute after updates.
- **docker-compose image-only triggers** — Only trigger on compose services with actual image changes.
- **docker-compose imageless services** — Skip compose services without an `image` field.
- **docker-compose implicit latest tag** — Normalize `image: nginx` to `image: nginx:latest` so compose triggers don't treat implicit latest as a version mismatch.
- **Express 5 wildcard routes** — Named wildcard route params for express 5 compatibility.
- **Semver filtering** — Fixed semver part filtering and prefix handling.
- **SMTP TLS_VERIFY inverted** — `rejectUnauthorized` was inverted; `TLS_VERIFY=false` now correctly allows self-signed certificates.
- **HA MQTT deprecated object_id** — Replaced `object_id` with `default_entity_id` for Home Assistant 2025.10+ compatibility.
- **Open redirect on authenticated pages** — Validate `next` query parameter to only allow internal routes.
- **Trigger test updateKind crash** — Test-button triggers no longer crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'updateKind')" on unvalidated containers.
- **Docker rename event not captured** — Added `rename` to Docker event listener so container name updates are captured after compose recreates.
- **UI duplicate drawer logo** — Removed duplicate logo in navigation drawer.

### Changed

- **TypeScript migration (app)** — Entire backend converted from JavaScript to TypeScript with ES Modules (`NodeNext`). 232 `.ts` files added/renamed, all `.js` source files removed.
- **TypeScript migration (UI)** — Vue 3 frontend migrated from JS to TS. 29 `.vue` files updated, component props/emits typed.
- **Jest → Vitest (app)** — All 64 app test files (664 tests) migrated from Jest to Vitest. Test runner unified across app and UI.
- **Jest → Vitest (UI)** — UI unit tests migrated from Jest to Vitest with improved coverage.
- **Vitest 4 + modern deps** — Upgraded vitest 3→4, uuid 11→13, flat 5→6, snake-case 3→4. Fixed vitest 4 mock constructor breaking change.
- **ESM baseline** — Cut over to `NodeNext` module resolution. Removed Babel, added `tsconfig.json`.
- **Biome linter** — Replaced ESLint with Biome for formatting and linting.
- **CI cleanup** — Removed Code Climate config, renamed Travis config to `ci.config.yml`.
